## 🛠 Usage  

### 🚀 **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**  
```bash
🔹 Open the app and connect your MetaMask wallet

🔹 Your account balance and address will be displayed
```

### 💰 **Step 2: Manage Your Wallet**  
```bash
✔ Create a new Ethereum wallet
✔ Import an existing wallet using a private key
✔ Store and manage ERC-20 tokens
```

### 🔄 **Step 3: Send & Receive Tokens**  
```bash
➜ Enter recipient address
➜ Specify the amount of ETH or tokens
➜ Confirm the transaction in MetaMask
➜ Transaction hash and status will be displayed
```

### 📊 **Step 4: Track Your Transactions**  
```bash
➜ View transaction history with timestamps and gas fees
➜ Monitor wallet balance in real-time
➜ Analyze blockchain activity using event logs
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations  
```bash
✔️ Private keys never leave the user’s browser (MetaMask handles key management)
✔️ Secure smart contract deployment using OpenZeppelin standards
✔️ Uses HTTPS and blockchain validation for safe transactions
✔️ Protection against phishing & transaction replay attacks
```

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
```bash
🟢 Multi-chain support (BSC, Polygon, Solana)
🟢 Mobile app for iOS & Android
🟢 Layer-2 scaling solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum)
🟢 Multi-signature wallets & biometric authentication
🟢 AI-powered transaction insights & gas fee prediction
🟢 DAO governance for community-driven development
```
